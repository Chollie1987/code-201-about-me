        <p>My name is Emily Greason. I am originally from North Carolina where I recieved a Bachelor's Degree in  Fine Art and Phsychology at Appalachian State University. 
             After graduating, I moved to Colorado to work in the retail cannabis industry before moving to Washington state to further my career in the cultivation side of cannabis. I have been working as an operations manager at a tier 2 indoor cannabis cutlivation facility since 2018. 
             Prior to that, I spent 3 years managing a small retail shop in a little mountain town in the Rocky Mountains.

        <p>In addition to operating a cannabis farm, I also sell my art online and at in-person markets. I create physical rendurings of illustrations and printmaking designs. 
            I am pursuing a career in tech as a software engineer because I am seeking job opportunities that are more challenging and fulfilling. I also want a career that will offer a more stable income and work-life balance.
            Some of my goals include establishing a more solid retirement fund, creating a self-sustaining side-hustle in selling art and establishing a career in tech that will support my dreams of international travel.
