# LAB - 2

## code-201-about-me

I have built an app that gives the user some information about me, my background, current career and my goals. 

I have added a guessing game with 7 questions, users are to guess the correct answers and are given a score at the end of the game.

### Reflections and Comments

The repetition of including mutliple if...else statements is a great way to memorize how to write the code correctly and it makes me feel like I am developing a solid foundation on which to write more advanced functions. I would like to learn how to embed gifs into my JS code because I want the alert to return gifs or images to the user based on their answers to my prompts. 

I need to go through the structure of while loops and it's variations further to fully grasp the concept and the way it is built out.
