### Reflections and Comments

The repetition of including mutliple if...else statements is a great way to memorize how to write the code correctly and it makes me feel like I am developing a solid foundation on which to write more advanced functions. I would like to learn how to embed gifs into my JS code because I want the alert to return gifs or images to the user based on their answers to my prompts.
